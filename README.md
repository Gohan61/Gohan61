# Hi, I'm GÃ¶khan

I'm a full-stack web developer based in Roermond, The Netherlands.

I started my developer journey by taking courses on Data Science and learning Python. I later moved on to full-stack web development by following [The Odin Project[(https://www.theodinproject.com/). Currently, I have finished this curriculum and I'm looking for oppurtunities to work as a full-stack developer.
